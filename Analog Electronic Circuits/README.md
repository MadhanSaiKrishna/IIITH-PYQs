# EC2.103 @IIITH

## **Course Outcomes**

`CO-1 ` - Describe the devices: diode, transistors and their operation. \
`CO-2` - Explain the operation for basic MOSFET & BJT circuits: mirrors, biasing circuits and different 
amplifier configurations.  \
`CO-3` - Draw equivalent circuit and examine the circuit, formulate gain & ac/dc parameters (dc analysis & 
small signal analysis). \
`CO-4` -  Demonstrate simulation of the above mentioned basic circuits, change parameters to obtain desired 
output. \
`CO-5` - Simulate, plot & perform frequency analysis of amplifiers, predict temperature based behavior and 
explain mismatch. \
`CO-6` - Design simple MOSFET biasing circuits and amplifiers.  \
`CO-7` - Design circuit on breadboard and characterize it.
