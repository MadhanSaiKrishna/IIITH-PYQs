# CS1.302 @IIITH

## **Course Outcomes**

`CO-1 ` - Explain the syntax of programming language constructs and their semantics and 
describe a program structure and its execution model. (Cognitive Level: Understand)   \
`CO-2` - Describe the steps in program editing, compilation and execution using tools such as 
Visual Studio Code, GCC compiler on a Linux/Windows/MAC operating system.   \
`CO-3` - Choose appropriate primitive data types and design new composite data types to model 
the relevant data in a given computation problem and also discover the algorithmic logic 
required to solve well-defined computational problems. (Cognitive Levels: Apply and 
Analyze)    \
`CO-4` -  Compare and contrast the performance of different algorithmic approaches for simple 
computational problems  with respect to time and memory. (Cognitive Levels: Analyze and 
Evaluate)   \
`CO-5` - Write programs involving basic dynamic data structures such as linked lists and use 
tools such as Valgrind to detect any memory leaks. (Cognitive Levels: Apply and Analyze) \
`CO-6` - Use debugging tools such as GDB proficiently to rapidly isolate and remove 
subtle/complex bugs in programs. (Cognitive Levels: Apply and Analyze)   \
`CO-7` -  Manage complex large projects using source code management tools such as GIT and 
build tools such as Make. (Cognitive Levels: Apply and Analyze) \
`CO-8` - Assess and evaluate the solutions of their classmates through a peer review process 
(Cognitive Level: Evaluate)
