## **Course Outcomes**

`CO-1 ` - :Explain the Von Neumann Model of Computing. Describe all the steps involved in the execution of a 
program: composition, compilation, assembly, linking, loading and hardware interpretation of the program 
instructions. (Cognitive Level: Understand)  \
`CO-2` - Describe the instruction set architecture design principles. Show how programming language constructs can 
be mapped to sequences of assembly language instructions. Analyze and assess any given ISA. (Cognitive Levels: 
Analyze and Evaluate)    \
`CO-3` -  Describe processor design architectural approaches. Compare and contrast sequential designs with pipelined 
designs. Propose new architectural approaches to optimize on performance and hardware costs (Cognitive Levels: 
Apply, Analyze and Create)       \
`CO-4` - Describe the basic functionality of an operating system. Clearly explain the system call interface, its design 
and implementation. Build systems akin to a bash shell, file server etc. using system calls. (Cognitive Levels: 
Understand and Apply) 
`CO-5` - Describe the basics of process control and management. (Cognitive Levels: Understand and Apply) \
`CO-6` - :Describe the principles of virtual memory management. Analyze various memory management schemes for 
process isolation and physical memory utilization across multiple processes (Cognitive Levels: Understand, Apply 
and Analyze)
