## **Course Outcomes**

`CO-1 ` - Solve problems pertaining to the application of Boolean algebra, number systems, and 
simplification of logic expressions using Karnaugh maps.   \
`CO-2` - Develop a simplified combinational circuit as a solution for a given problem.    \
`CO-3` - Analyze a real-world problem to develop a digital design solution using sequential circuits to 
solve the problem.   \
`CO-4` -  Describe the working of a basic 8-bit von Neumann architecture processor.   \
`CO-5` - Develop skills for simulating circuits using basic components on online simulation tools 
(example, Tinker CAD).  \
`CO-6` - Design, implement and test a given logic circuit using basic electronic components such as 
breadboards, ICs etc.  \
