implementation on controller boards and their interface to electronic circuits. Demonstrate 
proficiency on the same 
## **Syllabus**
`Unit 1:` **Know your equipment and components** - Lab Equipment and components 
familiarization such as Power supply, Signal Generator, Oscilloscope, Breadboard, 
Transistor, Resistor etc... \
`Unit 2:` **Design, Implementation and Analysis** - Implement circuits such as Voltage 
Regulator record, analyze and interpret the results. Around 3-4 circuits will be dealt 
with in this section. \
`Unit 3:` **Electronic Circuit Design Simulation Software** - Learning to install and use 
Multisim. Design one of the earlier experiments on Multisim and compare hardware 
and simulation results \
`Unit 4:` **The Art of Soldering** - Solder one of the implemented circuits now on a general 
purpose PCB/Vector Board, record results, compare with the previous implementation 
on the bread board \
`Unit 5:` **Hardware Software Symbiosis** - Use of controller boards to interface with 
electronic circuits and actuators, showcase the need for software-hardware interplay
