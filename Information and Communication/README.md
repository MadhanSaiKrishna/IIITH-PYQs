## **Course Outcomes**

`CO-1`- List all components in a typical communication system, and distinguish between analog 
and digital communications.   \
`CO-2`- Apply principles of information theory to calculate the entropy of a random source and 
the channel capacity of some simple noisy communication channels.     \
`CO-3`- Discuss Shannon’s Source Coding and Channel Coding Theorems and recognize their 
significance for modern communication.       \
`CO-4`- Employ probabilistic and combinatorial ideas to obtain a sketch of the proof of the 
Shannon’s source coding and channel coding theorems for some simple sources and channels. \
`CO-5`- Analyze the performance of Huffman source coding for any given random source and 
some basic error correcting codes for some simple noisy communication channels. \
`CO-6`- Evaluate the essential information and communication theoretic quantities in a wide 
variety of communication systems used in practice.
