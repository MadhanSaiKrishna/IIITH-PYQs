## **Course Outcomes**

`CO-1 ` - Describe various circuit elements (R, C, L), supply (current, voltage), devices (op amp, diode).   \
`CO-2` -  Explain the operation and characteristics of each circuit element, behavior in specific circuit 
configuration (DC, AC, series, parallel, mixed).      \
`CO-3` -   Calculate equivalent circuit parameters (Thevenin, Norton), node voltages, branch currents etc. 
using reduction, KCL, KVL and reduction techniques.     \
`CO-4` -  Calculate circuit response (steady state, transient) to various input stimulation. Calculate and 
understand the concept of time constant for RC, RL and RLC circuits. \
`CO-5` -  Demonstrate understanding of and calculate Power, Energy, Loss and phasors w.r.t. circuit.  \
`CO-6` -  Apply the above concepts to analyze and solve a real-life circuit problem. \
