## **Course Outcomes**

`CO-1 ` - describe the fundamental properties of the real numbers that underpin the formal development of 
real analysis. \
`CO-2` -  demonstrate the knowledge of an understanding of the theory of sequences and series    \
`CO-3` -demonstrate skills in constructing rigorous mathematical arguments \
`CO-4` - apply the theory in the course to solve a variety of problems at an appropriate level of 
difficulty \
`CO-5` -  demonstrate skills in communicating mathematics \
`CO-6` - analyse how abstract ideas and regions methods in mathematical analysis can be applied to 
important practical problems
